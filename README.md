# Vidgyor Build Tool

This tool is primarily built to make my life easier. This will take a bunch of javascript files from the `inputs` folder and spits those bunch of javascript files babeled, obfuscated and gzipped into the outputs folder.

## Getting Started

- To use this tool you need to have nodejs in your computer. Go to [Nodejs Website](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download nodejs from there.

- Once you have nodejs in your computer, clone this repository into your computer.

  `git clone https://github.com/GiriAakula/vidgyor-build-pipeline.git`

- Then install packages <br>

  `cd vidgyor-build-pipeline` <br>
  
  `npm install`

- Now move the javascript files you want to convert into inputs folder. Then run

    `npm run build`

- That's it! You have your files on the outputs folder.
